# Toronto Neighbourhoods Project

## Project Proposal

### Summary: 

This project is examining data from the City of Toronto to identify key attributes of neighbourhoods / municipalities. The goal of the project is to assist families with young children to make a decision on what will be the most ideal location for them to live / raise children based on these variables:
School accessibility, type, and location
Types of parks & recreation facilities
Neighbourhood crime rates

Project outcomes: 

Conduct exploratory analysis of the attributes above to gain a clear understanding of the layout of each municipality
Create an overlay map / multiple maps of the Toronto neighbourhoods to show these 3 variables with dropdown menus that update the map based on the 3 factors

### Questions to answer:

Exploratory
- How are crime rates changing over the years in the neighbourhoods from 2014 to 2023?
- What can we learn about peopleâ€™s hobbies by looking at the amenities?
- How many different types of schools are in the municipalities?

Mapping
- Which areas/neighborhoods are the best for families with young children to live based on these metrics?:
- Crime rate
- School type: Public vs Private, other variances?
- Parks & recreation - amenities
